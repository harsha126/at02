                        The genesis of AT-02 can be traced down to a fall of spring
                        in 1988, when a bunch of adolescent teens from all over
                        India made it to glorify their stint in the mighty Indian
                        Air Force. With the enrollment of the batch, the gang came
                        to be recognized as AT-02 entry and individuals reduced to a
                        Service no. It took 26 long months for grooming us and
                        transform the disordered and arrogant lifestyle into a
                        disciplined and committed one. Life became one with a vision
                        and mission. A true soldier was forged and yesterday’s
                        jokers turned into Gentlemen. Parade/Health run /Range
                        Firing/PT became the way of life and we grew smarter and
                        stronger. Studies in Electrical Technology and aviation
                        followed and we began to acquire a unique skillset. That
                        which will eventually be unleashed to perform on priceless
                        inventories that IAF dealt with. Reminiscing the good old
                        days we lived out in the training centre is like a fairy
                        tale being read out to kids. Keeping aside the torture of
                        the daily grind, life took many unexpected turns amidst the
                        company of friends. Amidst the frequent dreadful guard
                        duties was the opportunity of BO, Gardener, Key orderly,
                        Letter Orderly, Mess Member, Sick Orderly to be seized.
                        Bunking night studies to watch movies and escaping into the
                        civil realm in civil clothes without book out was a daily
                        affair. Remembering the chapatti haircut order metted out to
                        all of us just before we proceeded for leave for the first
                        time is a bone chilling memory till now. Punishments in the
                        Parade Ground and grass cutting in the lazy afternoons can
                        never be forgotten. Lot of memories, lots of persons, lots
                        of events associated to those memories are something which
                        shall never be forgotten. MWO Goswami, Cpl
                        Thomas/Tripathi/Bharat, JWO Jagtar Singh etc continue to
                        haunt our life. Whether it was Swami’s cart full of goodies,
                        or Akshaya Complex, the movie hall or the Gangamma Circle
                        shops, all of them kept us equally amused. Life in Billet
                        was a whirlwind amusement continuously in ecstasy. There
                        were those notorious groups and the musical ones, the
                        mischievous annecdotes and the pleasantries all in the same
                        frame. Food in the mess was tasty for the hungry souls but
                        gruesome if not hungry enough. Dil maangta more but options
                        were limited. Supper bar kept hopes alive. Ideas emerged
                        from the smoke of cigarettes and clandestine get-togethers
                        and we believed it was indispensable to live through. Who
                        cares for punishments? The pass out parade followed by the
                        Attestation ceremony earned us the coveted black belt we
                        aspired for and IAF became the cornerstone of our journey of
                        life. The training period ended with a lot of jubilation.
                        Lurking within the spiked spirits was the agony of
                        disintegration of AT-02 as we were shuffled out like cards
                        to various locations spanning all corners of our country. It
                        was impossible to keep contact and follow through any more.
                        No wonder every one of us stood to test of time, 17 years
                        passed. We kept going against the toughest climatic
                        conditions, compromised lifestyle, and immense work pressure
                        and yet the spring of our lives did not fail to give us the
                        most beautiful families. Blessed with our indomitable
                        attitude and the caring shoulders we came full circle having
                        completed our stint of 20 years in IAF and then parting ways
                        in search of a better livelihood. Technology crept in and
                        sent its avatars: Facebook and Whatsapp. The boon reunited
                        us and this time it pervaded our next generations as well.
                        Thanks to the pioneers who rejuvenated our lives through
                        annual Family Reunion functions held in different locations
                        every year. Today as Veterans, we stand taller having our
                        children adorn various positions serving our Motherland in
                        myriad ways. Each day of our IAF is etched in gold and as
                        fresh in our minds which keep us alive, strong and healthy.
